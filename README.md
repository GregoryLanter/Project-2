# Project-2

Project title: Sniffer

Project Concept: To help dog owners socialize their dogs and match up various dogs for play dates.

Project Motivation: Two dog owners both want to socialize their pets and let them have a fun play date.  The problem is they are scared of unfriendly dogs and other uncertainties.  We want to provide a safe way to let them meet up and play at a secure location.

Project Mission: Dogs are basically social animals that enjoy the company of their peers. Socialized dogs don’t get stressed when car horns honk, strange dogs bark, bicycles buzz by or crowds of people cruise past them. Sociable dogs live happy, care-free lives, so how can you help your dog become better socialized? Check this website out! Dogs, like people, need to practice their social skills. Spending time with other dogs will help your dog hone his ability to read his friends’ body language and to communicate effectively. This website can help you with that!

Project Design: We will use a mysql database accessed through sequelize to store and access info about dogs.  We will implement a calendar interface to help schedule and a location api to find various dog parks.

Project Technology: Mysql, node, express, sequelize, handlebars, eslint, travis, git, passport

Future ideas: 
 - each owner may have many dogs, so it would be nice to set a profile for each dog, so dogs have their own play dates.
 - have this app on Mobile responsive for an easy/faster use
 - have an ability to message each other through the website
 - set a date compare to dogs size 
 - have a functionality to set a play date with friends dogs and follow their events
 - have a functionality to avoid enemy dogs
